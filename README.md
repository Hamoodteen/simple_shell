## sh:
sh is also called Bourne Shell. sh is a command programming language described by POSIX standard. It is for UNIX or UNIX-like operating systems. It has many implementations. On most operating systems, sh is implemented by programs like dash, kash, and original Bourne Shell. sh is a Predecessor of bash. /bin/sh is an actual link to main implementations. It is a symlink in most POSIX systems.

sh is not a programming language itself. It is just a specification. sh is a detailed description of the syntax and semantics of the language. It doesn’t include an implementation. sh is written as a replacement for earlier UNIX shells. It’s most of the syntax is the same as the syntax of the ALGOL68 programming language.
